# Welcome

Welcome. 

You have reached my blog page. This page is my attempt to place all my findings and research onto one platform that can be searched, referenced and reused when i inevitably need to reinstall or resetup some system or another. The site is built on the fastpages development and has the capability of searching for tags for topic areas. The posts arent in any particular order but i have tried to link similar posts together in a coherent path. My background is in mechatronic engineering but much of my last couple of years has been working with Deep Learning, Docker and Embedded linux systems. As such many of the posts you see here revolve around these areas. Ultimately this blog is a place for me to store the information i have learnt for me to reuse in the future. If any of it is useful for you use as you wish. Some of the posts have been developed inside jupyter notebooks and i plan to have links to binder or colab pages for you to run the code in the browser. 

My linkedin, github and CV are linked above for anybody wishing to see some of my work.
